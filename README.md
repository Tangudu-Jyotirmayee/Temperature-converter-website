TASK-3 of my Web development and Designing internship at Oasis Infobyte.


üìå Project Title:TEMPERATURE CONVERTER WEBSITE

üíªThe temperature converter allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Users can input a value in any of the three temperature scales, and the other two scales will automatically update with the converted values. Additionally, there's a button to clear all input fields.

üîç Key Points:

1.User Interface: The website has a simple and clean user interface with input fields for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin, along with appropriate placeholders and icons.

2.Conversion Logic: JavaScript is used to handle temperature conversions dynamically as the user inputs values. Conversion formulas are implemented for Celsius to Fahrenheit, Celsius to Kelvin, Fahrenheit to Celsius, Fahrenheit to Kelvin, Kelvin to Celsius, and Kelvin to Fahrenheit.

3.Responsive Design: The website design is responsive, ensuring a good user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

4.Styling: CSS is used for styling, including colors, layout, and button styles, enhancing the visual appeal of the website.

5.Clear Button: A "Clear All" button is provided to reset all input fields at once for user convenience.

üë©‚Äçüíª Challenges:

1.Accuracy: Ensuring accurate temperature conversions across different scales and handling rounding errors appropriately.

2.Input Validation: Validating user inputs to handle scenarios like non-numeric input or extreme values that might cause calculation issues.

3.Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensuring consistent behavior and appearance across different web browsers.

4.Localization: Handling different decimal separators and temperature unit symbols based on the user's locale.

5.Accessibility: Ensuring the website is accessible to users with disabilities, including proper labeling of input fields and providing alternative text for icons.
